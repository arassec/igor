# Overview

## Examples
This section of the documentation contains examples of how to use igor in certain scenarios.

It will be populated with more examples as igor grows in functionality.

At the moment, there is only one example regarding regularly copying new files from one server to another.

::: tip
All examples use locally running docker images providing various services. 
You can use the `docker-compose.yml` file from igor's `e2e` module to start those services.
If you want the examples pre-configured for you, you can run igor's end-to-end tests as described in the <router-link to="/developer/developing.html">Developer Guide</router-link>.
