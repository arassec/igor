# Connector Editor

The connector editor is used to configure connectors.
It is split into two parts.

![connector editor](./images/connector/connector-editor.png)

## Connector Configuration

The connector configuration on the left side of the page is used to configure the connector.

![connector editor configuration](./images/connector/connector-editor-navigator.png)

The top element contains buttons for the following actions:

![return to job button](./images/connector/return-to-job-button.png) Navigates back to the job configuration from which the connector editor was opened. 
Only enabled if the editor was opened from within a job configuration.

![test button](./images/common/test-button.png) Tests the connector configuration and displays the results.

![save button](./images/common/save-button.png) Saves the connector.

Below the top element is the list of jobs that use this connector.
By clicking on an element in the list you can jump directly into the job editor for the corresponding job. 
 
## Parameters Editor

The parameters editor in the middle of the page contains all configuration parameters for the selected connector.

By selecting different categories and types, the configuration parameters will change accordingly.

The ![help](./images/common/help-button.png) button can be used to display the online help for the selected connector.
